# Assignment 1 - Personal Website | Web Development Course

## About the Website
This website was created as part of the first assignment in the Web Development course.

The subject I chose is **Moshe Nussbaum** â€“ a veteran Israeli crime and police affairs journalist, known for his work on Channel 12 News. I chose him because of his long and inspiring career in journalism and his personal resilience in the face of ALS.

The website includes multiple sections:
- **About Me** â€“ with a modern layout, subheadings, and visual elements like animated timeline and progress bar.
- **My Photos** â€“ presented in a horizontal scroll gallery with card styling.
- **My Playlist** â€“ includes 5 songs, 4 by Shlomo Artzi and 1 by Sasson Shaulov, displayed in a horizontal scroll music card style.
- **Like Section** â€“ allows users to like and share the page via Facebook.
- **QR Code** â€“ shows a QR code for easy mobile access to the site.
- **Q&A (SPA)** â€“ answers about the evolution of the web (Web1, Web2, Web3) in both English and Hebrew, as required.
- **Contact Me** â€“ includes a clean form, smiley dropdown, and proper validation.

The design uses **HTML5 and CSS3 only**, with no JavaScript, as required. I worked carefully to include semantic tags, responsive sections, and modern visual effects such as hover shadows, flex layouts, horizontal scroll, and subtle gradients.

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hello! My name is <strong>Moshe Nussbaum</strong>, and I am a veteran Israeli journalist known for my role as the senior crime and police affairs correspondent at Channel 12 News. I was born in Netanya in 1953 and began my professional journey in the Israel Defense Forces, serving as a paratrooper and later as a tank commander. After completing my military service, I joined the Israel Police, where I served as a detective and eventually transitioned into journalism.
  </p>

  <p>
    My career in media started with radio reporting at Kol Israel, and I later became a prominent figure in television journalism when I joined Channel 12 News in 1993. Over the years, I have covered many of the most significant criminal investigations and political scandals in Israeli history. My deep understanding of police work, combined with my calm and professional delivery, has made me a respected and trusted journalist.
  </p>

  <p>
    In my personal life, I am married and a proud father of three. I enjoy following sports, especially soccer and basketball, and have a strong passion for Israeli music. I also like spending quality time with family and friends. One of the most influential people in my life has been Ilana Dayan, a fellow journalist who has always inspired me with her investigative reporting and journalistic integrity.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 2022, I was diagnosed with ALS, a neurodegenerative disease that has challenged me physically but has not stopped me from continuing to work and inspire others. I believe in facing life with resilience, dignity, and humor.

      <strong>Shlomo Artzi Playlist</strong> – Shlomo has always been one of my favorite artists.  
      During one of his concerts, he dedicated a song to me — a deeply emotional moment that I will never forget.  
      His music continues to accompany me through every stage of life.

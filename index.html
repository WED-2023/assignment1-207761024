  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hello! My name is <strong>Moshe Nussbaum</strong>, and I am a veteran Israeli journalist known for my role as the senior crime and police affairs correspondent at Channel 12 News. I was born in Netanya in 1953 and began my professional journey in the Israel Defense Forces, serving as a paratrooper and later as a tank commander. After completing my military service, I joined the Israel Police, where I served as a detective and eventually transitioned into journalism.
  </p>

  <p>
    My career in media started with radio reporting at Kol Israel, and I later became a prominent figure in television journalism when I joined Channel 12 News in 1993. Over the years, I have covered many of the most significant criminal investigations and political scandals in Israeli history. My deep understanding of police work, combined with my calm and professional delivery, has made me a respected and trusted journalist.
  </p>

  <p>
    In my personal life, I am married and a proud father of three. I enjoy following sports, especially soccer and basketball, and have a strong passion for Israeli music. I also like spending quality time with family and friends. One of the most influential people in my life has been Ilana Dayan, a fellow journalist who has always inspired me with her investigative reporting and journalistic integrity.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 2022, I was diagnosed with ALS, a neurodegenerative disease that has challenged me physically but has not stopped me from continuing to work and inspire others. I believe in facing life with resilience, dignity, and humor.

  <h2>Q&A</h2>

  <!-- שאלה 1 -->
  <div class="spa-row">
    <div class="spa-block" dir="ltr">
      <h3>1. What are three main differences between Web1, Web2, and Web3?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Web1</strong> is read-only: users could view content but not interact with it.</li>
        <li><strong>Web2</strong> is read and write: users create and share content (social media, blogs, YouTube).</li>
        <li><strong>Web3</strong> is smart and personal: systems use AI and machine learning to adapt to user needs.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="spa-block" dir="rtl">
      <h3>מהם שלושה הבדלים עיקריים בין Web2, Web1 ו-Web3?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Web1</strong>:  אינטרנט סטטי – ניתן רק לצפות בתוכן, ללא אפשרות תגובה או שיתוף.</li>
        <li><strong>Web2</strong>:  אינטרנט אינטראקטיבי – המשתמשים יוצרים ומשתפים תוכן (רשתות חברתיות, בלוגים, YouTube).</li>
        <li><strong>Web3</strong>:  אינטרנט חכם ואישי – מערכות לומדות את המשתמש ומתאימות לו תוכן בעזרת AI ולמידת מכונה.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- שאלה 2 -->
  <div class="spa-row">
    <div class="spa-block" dir="ltr">
      <h3>2. Use case: Searching for a forgotten song</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Web1</strong>: A static lyrics site listing songs by decade.</li>
        <li><strong>Web2</strong>: Asking in music forums or social platforms like Reddit.</li>
        <li><strong>Web3</strong>: AI matches your audio and finds the song, even suggesting similar ones.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="spa-block" dir="rtl">
      <h3>תרחיש שימוש: חיפוש שיר ששכחת את שמו</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Web1</strong>: אתר סטטי עם רשימות שירים לפי עשורים.</li>
        <li><strong>Web2</strong>: שאלות בפורומים או רשתות חברתיות כמו Reddit.</li>
        <li><strong>Web3</strong>: מזמזם את הלחן – בינה מלאכותית מזהה את השיר ומציעה שירים דומים.</li>
